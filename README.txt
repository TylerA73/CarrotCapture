Known bugs: - Can't move the triangle very well. Always resizes first
	    - Can't select shapes that have been copied and pasted. The original can still be selected. Just not the clone. Shapes that have been cut and pasted still work.
	    - Copying/Cutting/Pasting triangles result in a small triangle.

Notes: This program uses fonts that are installed on windows machines. The fonts I chose to use are only found on windows machines, and not Linux/OSX. Changing the font on anything but Windows will not work. Saving the file will always save it in the project folder, regardless of the path you select.

Sometimes when changing computers, I need to manually select JDK 8 for the project, or else there will be a ton of errors. You may have to do this as well before running.
